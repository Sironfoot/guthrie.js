        Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for
        Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the
        nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill
        the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?

        Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then
        they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they
        decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television
        programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

        Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull
        this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you.
        But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through
        too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

        The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and
        the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds
        the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder
        of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger
        those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is
        the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

        My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there,
        and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there.
        Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna
        tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there,
        and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot.
        You understand?

        Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic,
        you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of
        the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when...
        You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
